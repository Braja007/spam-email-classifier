📧 Spam Email Classifier – Project Overview
This project is a Spam Email Classifier web application built using Flask and Scikit-learn. It classifies emails as Spam or Not Spam using a Logistic Regression model trained on a labeled dataset of emails. The input emails are transformed using TF-IDF Vectorization before prediction. The app includes a simple web interface for user input and real-time prediction.
